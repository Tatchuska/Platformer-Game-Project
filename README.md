# Side-Scrolling Game Project
Welcome to my side-scrolling game project repository! This project showcases my skills in game development using C++ and the raylib library. As an aspiring IT student looking for internship opportunities in the game development industry, I've dedicated time and effort to create a fun and engaging side-scrolling game with 2D pixel art assets.

## Project Overview
This side-scrolling game is a 2D pixel art adventure that combines classic gameplay elements with a modern touch. The project is implemented in C++ and utilizes the raylib library for graphics and input handling. The game features carefully crafted pixel art assets, contributing to a visually appealing and immersive gaming experience.

## Features
